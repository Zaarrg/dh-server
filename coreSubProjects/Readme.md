# Distant Horizons

This repo is for the Distant Horizons mod.
The purpose of this submodule is to isolate code that isn't tied to a specific version of minecraft. This prevents us from having duplicate code; reducing errors and potentially helping us port to different versions faster and easier.

Check out the mod's main GitLab page here:
